0.03  2003 June 11
        - Fix the tests to work in other time zones than my own!

0.04  2003 June 13
        - Add internationalization support (Month/weekday names).
        - Expose underlying function interface to all hashes.
        - Export %time and time_format by default.

0.05  2003 June 17
        - Add "tz" timezone format code to %time.
        - Change unambiguous month/minute format codes.
        - Some minor speed improvements.

0.06  2003 June 20

        - Minor documentation fixes (Thanks to Will Coleda!).
        - Add th/TH formatting codes.
        - Allow backslash escaping in format strings.

0.07  2003 June 21
        - Fix some bugs in the test suite -- NO changes to Format.pm
          (Thanks to CPAN tester Jeroen Latour!)

0.08  2003 June 22
        - Distribute correct SIGNATURE file; a bad one was distributed
          with v0.07.  (Thanks to Jeroen Latour again).

0.09  2003 June 23
        - Add more checking on the Date::Manip module, which dies messily
          if it gets upset about not finding things like Time Zone.  This
          affects the test suite only -- No changes to Time::Format.

0.10  2003 July 5
        - Some speed improvements.  Removed need for Exporter, Carp.
        - Add support for optional Time::Format_XS module.
        - More test suite changes, due to strftime not being nearly as
          standard as you'd think it would be.
        - Removed support for deprecated month/minute codes.

0.11  2003 July 7
        - Some changes for ActiveState Perl.  Thanks again to Will Coleda.

0.12  2003 July 20
        - Add \Q, \U, \L, \u, \l, \E handling in format strings.
        - Change "Month" (etc) to be defined as "locale-preferred
          capitalization" rather than "always ucfirst".  Thanks to
          Mark Jason Dominus for his thoughts on this topic.
        - Don't bother compiling the Perl routines until we know that
          the XS routines (in Time::Format_XS) are not available.

0.13  2003 August 1
        - Check that the version of Time::Format_XS matches our version.
        - Test suite now tests perl-only routines separately from
          XS-enabled routines.
        - Further delay compilation of time_format until needed.

1.00  2004 September 24
	- Increase version to 1.00.
	- More flexible version-compatibility checking with
	  Time::Format_XS
        - Fix some warning messages (and some typos) in tests.
