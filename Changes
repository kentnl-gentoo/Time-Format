0.03  2003 June 11

        - Add th/TH formatting codes.
        - Allow backslash escaping in format strings.

0.07  2003 June 21
        - Fix some bugs in the test suite -- NO changes to Format.pm
          (Thanks to CPAN tester Jeroen Latour!)

0.08  2003 June 22
        - Distribute correct SIGNATURE file; a bad one was distributed
          with v0.07.  (Thanks to Jeroen Latour again).

0.09  2003 June 23
        - Add more checking on the Date::Manip module, which dies messily
          if it gets upset about not finding things like Time Zone.  This
          affects the test suite only -- No changes to Time::Format.

0.10  2003 July 5
        - Some speed improvements.  Removed need for Exporter, Carp.
        - Add support for optional Time::Format_XS module.
        - More test suite changes, due to strftime not being nearly as
          standard as you'd think it would be.
        - Removed support for deprecated month/minute codes.
