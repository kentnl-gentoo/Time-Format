Time/Format version 0.02
========================

Time::Format provides a very easy way to format dates and times.  The
formatting functions are tied to hash variables, so they can be used
inside strings as well as in ordinary expressions.  The formatting
codes used are meant to be easy to remember, use, and read.

EXAMPLES

 $time{'Weekday Month d, yyyy'}   Thursday June 5, 2003
 $time{'Day Mon d, yyyy'}         Thu Jun 5, 2003
 $time{'DAY MON d, yyyy'}         THU JUN 5, 2003
 $time{'dd/mm/yyyy'}              05/06/2003
 $time{yymd}                      030605

 $time{'H:mm:ss am'}              1:02:14 pm
 $time{'hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu'}         13:02:14.171447

 $time{'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss.mmm'} 2003/06/05 13:02:14.171

 $strftime{'%A %B %e, %Y'}        Thursday June  5, 2003

 $manip{'%m/%d/%Y'}               06/05/2003
 $manip{'%m/%d/%Y','yesterday'}   06/04/2003
 $manip{'%m/%d/%Y','first monday in November 2000'}  11/06/2000


DEVELOPMENT STATE

Time::Format is a brand new module.  It has a decent test suite, but
it hasn't been used much in the Real World yet.  Thus it should be
considered "beta" software.  If six months pass without any bugs being
reported, or any features being added, I'll bump the version to 1.0.
